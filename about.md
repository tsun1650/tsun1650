<p>I wanted to create this personal page so that I could say that I made at least 1 thing during social isolation. Anything to stay sane right? I'm a computer science graduate from Georgia Tech, now living in Washington DC, learning how to make it as a software engineer at Capital One. When I'm not struggling through StackOverflow, I like to spend my time reading, watching movies, biking, exploring DC, and becoming deeply engrossed in a hobby for a month at a time.</p>
